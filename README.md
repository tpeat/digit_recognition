# Digit Recognition
Lemme get yo digits

### MNIST Dataset
```
Consists of 60,000 28x28 image of handwritten digits
40,000 for training
10,000 for validation
10,000 for testing
```

### KNN
What is a KNN? Stands for k nearest neighbor and is one of the simplest ML algorithms for digit rec.
```
Determines the nearness of a point based on distance from a point under consideration
No training time required
Easy to implement
```

# CNN
